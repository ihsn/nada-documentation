# Reports 

NADA logs events and generates summary reports. It is not a full usage
monitoring system, and it is highly recommended to implement one like
Google Analytics.

What is logged?

Where are the log files stored?

Size / storage / export

Keep or delete?

## Using the API 

The API provides much more flexibility to generate reports. Instead of
relying on the pre-defined reports, administrators should produce R or
Python scripts that can be run any time and generate reports (possibly
on crone jobs, with automatic sending by email).

Examples:

Use case X

Use case Y

Read site logs in R or Python
