# Use of the API by data users

The use of the NADA API for catalog administration has been documented
in multiple sections of the Administrator's Guide. Some API functions
are also accessible to the public. This section describes the
public-facing functionalities of the API.

When a NADA catalog is published, a web page must provide all necessary
documentation (technical and legal) to users.
