# Managing data requests

Some datasets will be declared as being accessible only under license.
This means that users need to be registered and submit a request for
accessing data. Typically, this is done at the study level, and only
apply to microdata and geographic datasets. Sometimes for a collection
(see bulk data access).

## Using the administrator interface

Datasets that are assigned the Access Type Licensed require approval
from a NADA administrator before the user can get access to the data
files. From the site administration there are a number of ways to see if
licensed requests have been received.

-   **In the dashboard**: Pending requests show up as red in the catalog
    quick summary section. Clicking on this link goes to the Licensed
    Survey Requests management page.
