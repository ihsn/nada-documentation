# Overview

NADA is an open source data cataloging and dissemination system. It serves as a portal for researchers to browse, search, compare, apply for access, and download datasets of multiple types: microdata from surveys and censuses, geospatial data, tables and time series, images, documents, as well as reproducible scripts. It complies with multiple metadata standards (DDI Codebook, Dublin Core/MARC, ISO19139, IPTC).

The name NADA stems from **NA**tional **D**ata **A**rchive. It was originally developed for the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) to support statistical agencies in building microdata catalogs. It has since then evolved into a more comprehensive data cataloguing application.
