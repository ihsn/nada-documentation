# Installation

## NADA requirements
NADA requires PHP, a MySQL database and a web server.

### PHP

The minimum required version is PHP 7.3 with the following PHP extensions enabled, see page `PHP configurations`:
- xsl
- xml
- mbstring
- mysqli

For Microsoft SQL Server, see page [`installation with SQL Server`](/installation-guide/installation-sqlsrv).

### Web server

- Apache 2.4 or later
- IIS 6/7.x or later
- NGINX

### Supported databases

- MySQL 5.x or MySQL 8
- Microsoft SQL Server with fulltext support

For MySQL, NADA supports version below 5.6 (no longer supported by MySQL community) but for better performance use the latest 5.7 or MySQL 8.

## Option 1: Download source code package

- NADA source code is hosted on Github: http://github.com/ihsn/nada
- Visit the release tab and download the latest zip package - https://github.com/ihsn/nada/releases
- Open and extract (unzip) the files to your local hard drive or web server where you want to install NADA.

### Copy files to your web server
Copy the files to a folder on the web server root folder. If installing on a localhost - for example the computer currently being working on – then copy and paste (or move) the files into the root folder (or a sub-folder) of the web server. If, however, the server is running on a remote host (such as an ISP), then this process will involve the use of a FTP client program or file manager from the ISP’s Cpanel.


::: tip NOTE
The folder name chosen will in many cases become the URL for the catalog. Examples for a folder name might be – data, microdata, catalog etc.
:::


The root folder is located in different places depending upon the operating system/distribution and web server package you are using and it might be called `htdocs`, `httpd`, or `www`. On Windows servers this might be located in the `inetpub` directory and on Linux in the `/var/www/html` directory. Consult the documentation for the operating system being used or contact the ISP if unsure where the root web folder is.


## Option 2: Download source code using GIT

You can use GIT to download NADA source code from Github, you'll need a GIT client installed to be able to run GIT commands. 


### Install GIT client

For running the GIT commands to get/clone the source code, you'll need to install GIT on your web server or your local machine. There are several options available:

- SourceTree - https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
- GIT SCM - https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Github Desktop - https://desktop.github.com/

There are many other GIT tools available, you can use whichever you prefer. Almost all GIT tools, come with a command line (CLI) tool. We will be using the GIT CLI commands.

### Download source code

To get the source code, use the following command. This will create a copy of the source code into a local folder on your machine or web server.

```bash

#this will create a folder named nada
git clone https://github.com/ihsn/nada.git 

#to create a different folder name
git clone https://github.com/ihsn/nada.git <folder-name>

```


## Set folders permissions
Change the permissions for the following folders and their contents to `READ/WRITE`.

**datafiles** – this is the folder where NADA stores data

::: tip NOTE
For added security, it is strongly recommended that the location of the datafiles directory be changed after installation to a location outside your web root structure.
:::

**logs** – this is where the log files will be stored
**files** - folder for storing sessions files, thumbnails and other temporary files


### For IIS on Windows

On Windows servers make sure the `IIS AppPool\<applicationpoolname>` user has `read/write/delete` permissions. If you are using the `default App Pool`, the user account is named `IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool`.

### Linux
For linux, you can run the following command to set the permissions

```bash
$ chmod -R 755 datafiles files logs
```

Make sure you set the web server user account to be owner of the files and folders. For example, if you are running Apache with the user account `www-data`, run this command to change the ownership:

```bash
$ chown www-data:www-data -R <nada-root-folder> 
```


## Configure MySQL database

1. Browse to the `your-nada-web-folder/application/config` folder.

2. Make a copy of the file `database-sample.php` and rename it to `database.php`
3. Open the `database.php` file in a text editor like Notepad or Notepad ++, and fill in the following informaiton:

`hostname` - ipaddress or the machine name where database is hosted

`username` - database user name 

`password` - database password

`database` - database name


```php{4-7}

$db['default'] = array(
	'dsn'	=> '',
	'hostname' => 'localhost',
	'username' => 'nada_user',
	'password' => '<db-pass-here>',
	'database' => 'nada',
	'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',
	'dbprefix' => '',
	'pconnect' => FALSE,
	'db_debug' => FALSE,
	'cache_on' => FALSE,
	'cachedir' => '',
	'char_set' => 'utf8',
	'dbcollat' => 'utf8_general_ci',
	'swap_pre' => '',
	'encrypt' => FALSE,
	'compress' => FALSE,
	'stricton' => FALSE,
	'failover' => array(),
	'save_queries' => TRUE,
	'prefix_short_words'=>TRUE
);

```

4. Save the file.

::: tip NOTE
Do NOT use the root username and password (MySQL) or SA Account (MSSQL) on your production server. Create a separate user name and password for your NADA database. This can be done either from your Cpanel or from PhpMyadmin, MySQL Workbench.
:::

### Create database user account

You'll need to create an empty database for NADA to use. You'll need to use a database client such as MySQL Workbench, PhpMyAdmin or Command line:


From the command line type to connect using the `root` account:

```
$ mysql -u root –p
```

To create a new blank database, run:

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE nada;
```

Now create a user who can access the new nada database and give the user only the rights necessary to run the NADA.

```
mysql> CREATE USER 'nada'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,LOCK TABLES ON nada.* TO 'nada'@'localhost';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;;
```

**`yourpassword`** -  can be anything you choose. It is a good practice to use a password that contains text, numbers and special characters.

:::tip NOTE 
Make sure to write it down, you will need it to configure your NADA!
:::

Then exit MySQL console by typing exit.

```
mysql> exit
```

### Running the installer

Open web browser to the location of the NADA installation. For example: http://your-domain/nada-folder-name, or http://localhost/nada-folder-name.

Check that all settings are marked with a green tick and fix any that are not on your webserver before running the installer. See page [PHP configurations](installation-guide/php-settings) to update PHP extensions and configurations.

Click on the Install Database button and complete the form to create an initial Site Administrator account.

:::tip Complex Password 
Create a complex password at least 12 characters long with some uppercase, punctuation and numbers to aid security of your site. Do not forget this username and password!
